# Cache Components, scoped reads and writes

This is the route a product takes from a console that renders every request to one whose shell prerenders, whose pages
read through an authorized and cached `read()`, and whose writes drop exactly their tenant's collection. Every
migration `update` reports for 0.5.0 names a section below. `live.md` carries the live stream and its
refresh.

The starters are the template's own files. A product keeps their shape and replaces the policy, the session and the
database predicates with its own. Copy a starter whole, then change only what the section says is yours to change.

## Turn Cache Components on

Set both flags in the Next config (`optional:next.config.ts`):

```ts
const config: NextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,
  partialPrefetching: true,
};
```

Every route that is not an API route must then be static or partial. A route that reads the request, the clock or an
uncached source puts that part inside a `Suspense` boundary of its own, so the rest of the route prerenders and the
boundary streams in. A page or layout that `await`s `connection()` at its top opts the whole route out of prerendering;
remove that and read the request-dependent data behind a boundary. A promise built from `connection()`, such as
`connection().then(() => ...)`, that a component resolves behind a boundary is how the shell reads the environment
without blocking the frame. `node scripts/route-policy.ts` classifies every route of a production build and fails a
route that is neither static nor partial, unless `optional:scripts/verify.config.ts` lists it in `requestDependentRoutes` with a
reason.

A navigation is as fast as where its data comes from. Data read through `read()` (cached and tagged, so a write
refreshes it) is in the prerendered shell; prefetching brings it, and the page is whole in about 30 ms. A request-time
read has to sit behind a Suspense boundary (a route's `loading.tsx`, or one inside the page), and React keeps a fallback
it has shown on screen for at least 300 ms (`FALLBACK_THROTTLE_MS`): measured on the template with Members read per
request, the content arrived at 325 to 329 ms on a desktop and about 490 ms on the phone profile, against 29 ms
through `read()`. So read through `read()` wherever the data allows, and keep request-time reads for what must be per
request. Where one stays, put its boundary as low as it can go, so the masthead and everything cached show at once and
only the request-time part waits. Without Cache Components, a route with no `loading.tsx` simply waits for its page,
and the rail answers the click at once: a link's icon turns into a spinner while its page is on the way
(`useLinkStatus`). `scripts/navigate.ts` times this honestly: its `data` time is when the mapping's `readySelector`
shows real, visible content, never a skeleton's rows or a page the router keeps hidden.

## The shell's assistant promise

`AppShell`'s `assistant` prop is a `Promise<boolean>`, and `useAssistantAvailable()` returns that promise. The layout
hands the shell a promise and does not await it:

```ts
const assistant = connection().then(() => assistantConfig(process.env) !== null);
```

Read the promise with `use()` inside a small `Suspense` boundary that keeps the control's space:

```tsx
function AssistantSection() {
  const available = use(useAssistantAvailable());
  if (!available) return null;
  return <AssistantSettings />;
}
```

The launcher keeps its place, inert and hidden from assistive technology, until the promise resolves `true`, so
resolving never moves the row. An unavailable assistant is never a clickable dead control.

## The clock is the data's

`formatRelative(input, now)`, `Freshness`, `ShellTools` and `AlertsPanel` take a required `now`: the data's clock, which is
the `observedAt` a `read()` returned, or `clock()` from `optional:src/data/collections.ts`. None of them reads the
browser's clock, so a prerendered page and its hydration agree. Pass `now={observedAt}` to `<Freshness>` and
`formatRelative(at, observedAt)` in a view; a view that formats times takes `now` as a prop from its page.

## Authorized, scoped reads

A page calls `read(name, query)` and never `collection.query()`. `read()` resolves the caller itself, so no caller can
choose a tenant. It refuses a collection the caller may not read before any cached code runs, and the cached function
it calls sees only the whole `AccessScope`, the collection's name and the normalized query, never a mutable collection.

The profile is `{ stale: 30, revalidate: 60, expire: 3600 }`. The tag is `collection:<sha256 of canonical [tenantId,
collectionName]>`: bounded, deterministic and free of any raw identifier. The real cache key still includes the subject
and the authorization identity, because the cached function's arguments include the whole scope. `authorizationKey`
must change whenever what the scope may see changes; derive it on the server from current permissions or a trusted
authorization revision. If an adapter cannot supply a stable, correct visibility identity, leave its read uncached
until it can.

`optional:src/data/access.ts` builds `resolveAccess`, `collectionFor` and `can` from one policy. The sample binds a
single scope. A product replaces `policy.current` with its session (null when there is none), `policy.bind` with the
collection of that tenant with its database predicate already applied, and `policy.allows` with its permission check.
A production adapter binds the predicate and the subscription filter; prepending a cache key is not isolation.

```ts
/**
 * Who the current request is and what they may do: the one place a page, a server action and the assistant ask. It also
 * answers the console's chrome (`chromeAccess`), which reads the same scope once more, for what the rail draws.
 *
 * This is the demo policy. It signs the request in as the sample member the `zz_meridian_view_as` cookie names, or as
 * Maya Chen (`members_1`) when there is no cookie, and answers `allows` from that member's record: the roster is read
 * again on every call, so a role change or a suspension takes effect at the next operation, and there is never a
 * fallback to the Owner or to anyone else. The grants come from the role table (`effective`), limited to the
 * operations each collection supports. A cookie naming an unknown or non-Active member gives no session, so
 * `resolveAccess` throws `Unauthenticated`.
 *
 * A product replaces this policy: `current` reads its own session (null when there is none), `bind` returns the
 * collection of that tenant with its database predicate already applied, and `allows` says what the scope may do with
 * each collection. `authorizationKey` must change whenever what the scope may see changes, because the cached read
 * keys on it.

`optional:src/data/read.ts` is the cached read and the tag helper:

 * helper below sees only the whole scope, the collection's name and the normalized query. A write calls
 * `updateTag(collectionTag(tenantId, name))` after it commits, which drops every user's cached variants of that
 * collection and nobody else's.
 */
import { createHash } from 'node:crypto';
import { cacheLife, cacheTag } from 'next/cache';
import { normalizeQuery, type Query } from '@/lib/collection';
import { AccessDenied, collectionFor, can, resolveAccess, type AccessScope } from '@/data/access';
import { clock } from '@/data/collections';

/** `collection:` and the SHA-256 of the tenant and the name: bounded, deterministic and free of any raw identifier. */
export const collectionTag = (tenantId: string, name: string): string =>
  `collection:${createHash('sha256').update(JSON.stringify([tenantId, name])).digest('hex')}`;

async function cachedRead(scope: AccessScope, name: string, query: Query) {
  'use cache';
  cacheTag(collectionTag(scope.tenantId, name));

  if (!(await can(scope, name, 'read'))) throw new AccessDenied();
  return cachedRead(scope, name, normalizeQuery(collectionFor(scope, name), q));
}
```

`normalizeQuery` (in `optional:src/lib/collection.ts`, Meridian's) defaults and caps the limit and offset, rejects an
unknown field or operator, and sorts by the collection's key last. A caller cannot supply or remove an authorization
predicate through `where`: the predicate belongs to the bound collection.

A page moves like this:

```tsx
// before
const { rows } = await members.query({ sort: { field: 'joined', dir: 'desc' } });
// after
const { rows, observedAt } = await read('members', { sort: { field: 'joined', dir: 'desc' } });
```

Format every freshness against `observedAt`, which is the time the read actually ran and not the render's.

## Writes authorize, then invalidate

A Server Action authorizes the operation and every record it touches, writes through the caller's own collection, and
only after the commit drops the tenant's cached reads with `updateTag`. A refused change writes nothing, emits nothing
and invalidates nothing. Never call `updateTag` before the write has committed, and never write through a collection
that is not bound to the caller's scope. A Route Handler has no `updateTag`; it calls `revalidateTag(tag, { expire: 0 })`.

```ts
'use server';

import { updateTag } from 'next/cache';
import { can, collectionFor, resolveAccess } from '@/data/access';
import { collectionTag } from '@/data/read';

export async function removeMember(id: string) {
  const scope = await resolveAccess();
  if (!(await can(scope, 'members', 'remove', [id]))) return { ok: false, error: 'You do not have permission to make this change.' };
  await collectionFor(scope, 'members').remove!([id]);
  updateTag(collectionTag(scope.tenantId, 'members'));
  return { ok: true };
}
```

Do not use the profile `'max'` on a writer path: it is the profile of a read.

## The assistant route

`optional:app/api/assistant/route.ts` resolves access before the model is reached: 401 without a session. It hands the
assistant only the caller's own collections that the caller may read. Each approved create, update or remove asks a
guard, with the records it touches, at the moment it runs, and a permission revoked since the approval refuses it with
"You no longer have permission to make this change." and changes, emits and invalidates nothing. A committed change
drops its tenant's cached reads with `revalidateTag(collectionTag(scope.tenantId, name), { expire: 0 })`.
`assistantTools(collections, writer, guard)` and `respond({ ..., guard })` take that guard.

```ts
const scope = await resolveAccess().catch((e: unknown) => { if (e instanceof Unauthenticated) return null; throw e; });
if (!scope) return new Response(null, { status: 401 });
const readable = (await Promise.all(collections.map(async (c) => ((await can(scope, c.name, 'read')) ? collectionFor(scope, c.name) : null)))).filter((c) => c !== null);
const guard = {
  authorize: async (name: string, op: 'create' | 'update' | 'remove', ids?: string[]) => {
    const now = await resolveAccess().catch(() => null);
    return now !== null && now.tenantId === scope.tenantId && now.subjectId === scope.subjectId && can(now, name, op, ids);
  },
  invalidate: (name: string) => revalidateTag(collectionTag(scope.tenantId, name), { expire: 0 }),
};
```
