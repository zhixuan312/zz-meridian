# Customising a Meridian project

The order that keeps a build calm: data, navigation, pages, extras, clean-up. Read the files named here before changing
them; each starts with a comment that explains its job. In an adopted project `@/` is the team's own alias, so the
presets' `@/components/…` and `@/lib/…` imports become `@meridian/components/…` and `@meridian/lib/…` when you copy them.

## Data: `optional:src/data/`

`optional:src/data/` is the product's own seam: pages and views import data from it and nowhere else. Write `src/data/<product>.ts`. The template's
sample, ZZ Meridian's own dashboard, lives in `optional:src/system/fixtures/`; your pages never import it, but
`optional:src/data/collections.ts` does, so it stays until each collection's `rows` come from your data (see "The assistant").

- **Types from the person's world.** Turn their schema, CSV headers or API into TypeScript types (`Order`, `Shipment`,
  `Invoice`). Name fields the way their team says them.
- **Deterministic sample data** until their API is wired: a seeded generator and a fixed clock (`DEMO_NOW`), never
  `Math.random()` or `new Date()` in render, or the server and the client disagree and React reports a hydration error
  (the audit fails on it).
- **Daily series** for anything a Metric tile or chart shows over time: the Meridian cursor reads one value per day.
- **Freshness** from when data arrived (`DEMO_UPDATED_AT`), never from now.
- **null for "not measured"**: the formatters in `src/lib/format.ts` render it as a dash. Add a formatter there when a
  quantity needs one (weight, distance), never inline; a chart names its format by key, so a new quantity a chart
  shows also gets a key in `NumberFormat`, `FORMATTERS` and `AXIS_FORMATTERS`. Money follows `app.currency`.
- **Helpers a server page calls** (summaries, derived sentences) go in `optional:src/data/` or `src/lib/`, never in a
  `'use client'` view file: a server component cannot call a function exported from a client module.
- **Read on the server when you can**: a server component that awaits its data sends a page with the numbers in it.
  If a page must fetch in the browser (a client hook against an existing API), its reads start only after the
  JavaScript has loaded and run, about 2.5 s on a mid-range phone, which puts LCP past the limit. Call
  `preload(url, { as: 'fetch', crossOrigin: 'anonymous' })` from `react-dom` inside the read hook: the server render
  writes a preload into the HTML, and the read starts with the page (ZZ Console measured about 170 ms instead).
  `pnpm verify --full` measures LCP on that phone profile (`scripts/vitals.ts`).

## Navigation: `src/app.config.ts`

`app` holds the name, workspace, accent, timezone, currency and the signed-in user the rail shows (all set by
`scripts/brand.ts`); `slug`, `domain` and `toolPrefix` derive from the name. `nav` is the rail and the command
palette: groups of `{ href, label, icon }` (icons from `lucide-react`, 1.75 stroke is applied by the rail). A badge is a
short string, used only for something that needs attention ("1").

## Pages: presets to start from

| They need | Copy and adapt | Its protagonist |
|---|---|---|
| A summary with one leading figure | `optional:app/(dashboard)/(overview)/page.tsx` + `optional:src/views/overview.tsx` | Featured metric with its trend |
| A list of records with filters | `optional:app/(dashboard)/requests/` + `optional:src/views/requests.tsx` | Data table with filter bar |
| One record | `optional:app/(dashboard)/requests/[id]/` + `optional:src/views/request.tsx` | Detail head and key facts |
| Breakdowns and patterns over time | `optional:app/(dashboard)/analytics/` + `optional:src/views/analytics.tsx` | Heatmap or the main chart |
| Systems and incidents | `optional:app/(dashboard)/health/` + `optional:src/views/health.tsx` | Status summary |
| Customers, accounts, people | `optional:app/(dashboard)/customers/` + `optional:src/views/customers.tsx` | Table with sparklines |
| Keys, tokens, secrets | `optional:app/(dashboard)/keys/` + `optional:src/views/keys.tsx` | Table with masked values |
| Records people add, edit and remove (also what the assistant reads) | `optional:app/(dashboard)/members/`, `optional:app/(dashboard)/keys/` + `optional:src/views/members.tsx`, `optional:src/views/keys.tsx` | Data table over a collection |
| Settings (a sample: keep only if asked; its Assistant section holds the assistant's switch) | `optional:app/(dashboard)/settings/` + `optional:src/views/settings.tsx` | Form sections |
| Sign in, not found | `optional:app/sign-in/` (`page.tsx` + `panel.tsx`), `optional:app/not-found.tsx` + `optional:src/views/standalone.tsx` | One sentence at display size |

The health preset assumes software services. For other things that are up or not (warehouses, branches, sites), pass
`StatusList` a `noun`, a `measure` ("on time") and a `metric`, and `UptimeBars` a `measure`. A Metric tile says what
its change compares with in `compare` ("vs the 3 days before") and takes a `note` where no comparison fits.

Rules that make every page look like it belongs:

- **`PageFrame`** with `kicker` (where it sits: "Product · Workspace" or the parent record), `title`, one-sentence
  `description`, then `meta` (Freshness) and `actions` (one primary at most).
- **`Stack` of `Row`s.** Splits are `full`, `1/2`, `2/3`, `1/3` and `tiles`. Cards in a row are the same height; one card
  per cell (a column of tiles is fine in a 1/3 cell).
- **One protagonist.** At most one `FeaturedMetric` per page; everything else is a `MetricTile` or a `Card`.
- **Charts on one page share one `Meridian`** (wrap the rows in `<Meridian dates={...}>`), so pointing at a day reads it
  everywhere. Two measures of a different size are two charts, never one chart with two axes.
- **Tables**: mark one column `grow` (the lead), numbers `numeric`, low-value columns `hideBelow`; give `rowHref` so rows
  open their record. Below 768px a data table becomes a card list by itself.
- **Every state**: loading (`loading.tsx` with skeletons shaped like the page), empty (Empty state with the one action),
  error (`error.tsx`, what failed and Retry).
- **A file picker** is a visible `Button` that calls `input.click()` on an `<input type="file">` with `tabIndex={-1}`
  and `aria-hidden`, so the keyboard reaches the button and never the hidden input; give the press a state of its own
  ("Choosing the files…") until the change event arrives. The presses count a file chooser that opens as an answer.
- **A page spec** next to each route (`README.md`: summary, Structure, States, Surfaces, Agents), so the next person, or
  agent, knows what the page is for. `node scripts/check.ts` requires Structure and States, and under `## Agents` a
  `### What the agent reads` part for every page in `optional:app/(dashboard)/` and `optional:app/embed/`.
- **A shared context** for each page (decision 0011): a pure function beside the view builds it from the page's data
  (copy `optional:src/views/overview-context.ts`: scope, freshness, each figure with its unit, change and definition,
  what `optional:src/lib/insight.ts` finds, what the data cannot say), and the view passes it to `useShareView`; a
  server page with no client view places `<ShareContext context={…} />` among its cards instead. Both
  agents read it: an MCP host and the console's assistant. Add the page's tool to `optional:src/views/tools.ts` so the
  assistant can open it at an address.

## The assistant

The dashboard carries an assistant panel (`src/components/patterns/assistant/`, mounted by `AppShell`). It is off until
the variables are set, read per request, so no rebuild is needed: `ASSISTANT_PROVIDER` (`anthropic` or
`openai-compatible`), `ASSISTANT_API_KEY` and `ASSISTANT_MODEL` are required, and `ASSISTANT_BASE_URL` is required for
`openai-compatible`. `example:docs/assistant.md` in the template has the full guide.

The layout hands the shell whether it is on as a promise it does not await, `assistant={connection().then(() => assistantConfig(process.env) !== null)}`, so the request never blocks the frame; `AppShell` resolves it behind its own boundaries, and `useAssistantAvailable()` returns the same promise.

- **Collections** live in `optional:src/data/collections.ts`: one `arrayCollection` per kind of record, with `rows`, the `fields`
  schema, `allow` (which of create, update and remove the assistant may propose) and `hidden` fields. Replace each
  `rows` with the person's API and `clock` with `new Date()`; the assistant reads and proposes changes only through them.
  **When `rows` becomes a real database, read through `read()`** (`optional:src/data/read.ts`): a page asks for the same
  records from several places (the layout's shell tools, a page strip, the page and its freshness stamp), and `read()`
  caches per caller's scope and refreshes exactly the tenant a write touched, so do not wrap the read in a second cache;
  writes call `updateTag` after the commit (`cache.md`). Raise the pool's idle timeout too: `pg` drops an idle connection after 10s, and a remote Postgres with TLS
  costs hundreds of milliseconds to reconnect. Issue #7 has the numbers. A pool that keeps connections idle must also
  listen for their loss: `pool.on('error', (e) => console.error('db: an idle connection closed', e))`. Without it, the
  database or its pooler closing an idle connection is an uncaught `error` event and the server exits (issue #16); the
  pool has already dropped the broken client, so logging is enough. Set `connectionTimeoutMillis` too, so a database
  that does not answer fails a read instead of hanging it.
- **Sign-in check** goes in three places, the same check: `optional:app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`, `optional:app/api/assistant/route.ts` and every server action (each `actions.ts`), because a server action is a public endpoint the layout does not guard
  (before the model is reached).
- **The switch** ("Show the assistant") is in `optional:src/views/settings.tsx`. A product that deletes Settings moves it, or the
  person can no longer hide the panel.

## Brand beyond the accent

To change the brand of an adopted or created project, run `npx zz-meridian@<installed version> brand [brand flags]` (the
flags are the ones `adopt` takes, for example `--hex '#2E6BE4'` or `--name "Acme Ops"`). It rewrites the brand outputs
under `tokens/` and `src/styles/` and `src/app.config.ts`, and records the new brand and the new baseline hashes in
`optional:.meridian/manifest.json` together, so a later `update` replays the brand you chose. It needs a clean git tree, and it
changes nothing and says why when an update is in progress, the version differs from the manifest's, a brand output was
edited by hand, or `src/app.config.ts` is not in the shape `scripts/brand.ts` reads. The product's own `pnpm brand`
stays a local edit: it is not recorded, so a later `update` would replay the old brand over it.

Branding is configuration, not source patching: `scripts/brand.ts` edits `src/app.config.ts` and the token files, and
never `src/lib/preferences.ts`, which reads the accent and theme defaults from the app configuration.
Logo: set `logo: '/logo.svg'` in `src/app.config.ts`, a root-relative local SVG served from `public/`. `AppMark` renders it
at 20, 24, 28 and 32 pixels with an empty alt beside the app name, and with the app name as alt when given a `label`.
Any other value renders the default mark.
Theme default: `node scripts/brand.ts --theme dark|light` sets `theme` in `src/app.config.ts`; it applies before paint and
in `Providers` until a person chooses another in Settings. With no `theme`, the system theme applies. Density: users pick it in the rail's appearance menu and the
command palette; compact suits operators who scan many rows.

## MCP App views (only if asked)

Each `app/embed/<view>/` route is an MCP App: a `ui://` resource an MCP server returns beside a tool result. Copy
`optional:app/embed/overview/` for a summary or `optional:app/embed/requests/` for a list; wrap the content in `EmbedFrame`; call
`useShareView(context)` with the page's context (copy `optional:src/views/overview-context.ts`) so the model knows what is on screen; put `AskAbout` on cards worth asking about; agent
writes go through `Proposal` (see `optional:app/embed/proposal/`). Read `agents.md` next to this file for the server side.

## Clean-up before validation

Delete the sample pages, views and embed views the product does not use, with their nav lines. Do not delete
`optional:src/system/fixtures/` or `optional:src/system/sample-cells.tsx` yet: `optional:src/data/collections.ts` and `optional:src/data/sample.ts`
import the fixtures. Once your collections' `rows`, `clock` and the layout's `DEMO_NOW` and `ALERTS` come from your own
data and nothing imports them, delete them (with the Atlas kept, the previews read them: leave them, and remove the
pages' entries in `PAGES` in `example:src/system/content.ts`). Keep `optional:src/data/collections.ts`, `optional:src/lib/collection.ts`,
`src/lib/assistant/`, `optional:app/api/assistant/` and the assistant panel, unless the person does not want the assistant (it
then stays off without them). Then fix what still points at the sample:

- `optional:src/views/standalone.tsx`: the footer status line and its link to `/health`, and `optional:app/not-found.tsx`'s "Check service
  health" link.
- `src/components/patterns/shell-tools/index.tsx`: the alerts count ("Alerts · 1 new") is sample copy.
- `optional:app/sign-in/page.tsx`: the headline and lead describe the sample product.
- `example:src/system/content.ts`: `PAGES` names a sample request id route.
- Each page `README.md`: its States rows must describe what your view renders; `check.ts` only checks that the section
  exists.

This finds what is left:

```sh
grep -rn "/health\|/requests\|/customers\|/keys\|/settings\|fixtures/sample\|sample-cells" app src/views src/components \
  --include=*.tsx | grep -v preview.tsx
```

Then `node scripts/registry.ts` and `pnpm verify --full`.

## Renaming a thing

Routes, API paths, tool names (`query_enhancements` → `query_initiatives`), seeds and tables are yours to rename. The
assistant walk-through (`scripts/assistant.ts`) checks what every product shares on your own rail, and drives the
template's sample Overview, Members, API keys and Settings only while their files are there: replace one and its steps
print `n/a` with the reason, never a failure, so you never edit Meridian's scripts to rename your pages. The live checks
(`scripts/live.ts`) work the same way with the sample Members page. `scripts/verify.config.ts`'s `detailRoutes` name ids from the sample, and its `navigationChecks` and `smokeRoutes` name routes and titles, so they move too.

## Things that render nothing (and fail the gate)

Meridian resets Tailwind's own scales, so only its names exist: `font-regular|medium|semibold`, `rounded-xs…xl|full`,
`shadow-card|raise|overlay|control|accent|halo`, `text-2xs…2xl|page|hero|display`, and colour roles such as `bg-surface`,
`text-ink-2`, `border-line`, `text-accent-ink`. `font-bold`, `rounded-2xl`, `shadow-lg`, `bg-white`, `text-gray-500` emit
no CSS. Spacing is the 4px multiplier (`p-6` is 24px).
