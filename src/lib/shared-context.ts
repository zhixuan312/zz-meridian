 * A view's shared context: the one account of what a view shows that both agents read (decision 0011). An MCP host gets

 * it. Plain data, serialisable, safe on the server and in the browser.

 * Every context is the WHOLE state of the view, never a delta: a host keeps only the latest update. The text carries
 * everything, because a host is not required to give the model the structured part.
