/**
 * A collection bound to the person it was handed to, for the assistant route (`app/api/assistant/route.ts`).
 *
 * Listing a tool is not enforcement. A route hands the assistant the collections this caller may read, and the model
 * may hold a `query_<name>` tool across several turns; by the time that tool runs, the person may have been suspended,
 * demoted or signed out. `scopedQuery` wraps the collection's `query` so it re-checks, at the moment it runs, that the
 * request still resolves to the same person of the same tenant and that they may still read the collection — refusing
 * with the one `AccessDenied` message otherwise, and reading through the collection it was given.
 *
 * It is its own module, not a helper in the route: a Next route handler file may export only its handlers, so the
 * re-check lives here where a test can drive it directly.
