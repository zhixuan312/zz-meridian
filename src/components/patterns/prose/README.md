# Prose

Prose renders markdown a person wrote (a document, an incident review, a note, an agent's reply) for reading, safely: raw HTML stays text, and a link or an image goes only where a reader would agree to go.

Status: beta

## Anatomy

1. **Measure**: running text holds to 72 characters; `text-base` at 1.7 (`sm`: `text-sm`, relaxed) in `ink-2`, `ink` for headings and bold.
2. **Headings**: the writer's `#` is an h2 (`text-xl`), `##` an h3 with a hairline above it, `###` an h4: the page keeps the only h1.
3. **Lists**: discs and numbers in `ink-3`; task boxes drawn as checkboxes named "Done" or "Not done".
4. **Code**: inline on `surface-sunk` with a `line` border; a fenced block on `surface-sunk`, `radius-lg`, wrapping instead of scrolling.
5. **Tables**: inside a `line`-bordered frame, a `surface-sunk` header row, `text-sm` cells.
6. **Quote**: a 2px `accent` rule on the left, `ink` text.
7. **Links**: `.link`, in `accent-ink`, underlined on hover; a link out of the product sends no referrer.

## Composition

`react-markdown` with `remark-gfm` (tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks) and no raw-HTML plugin; every element drawn on Meridian's roles. URLs pass `safeMarkdownUrl` (`src/lib/safe-markdown.ts`).

## Data

A markdown string. Line endings are normalised and the ends trimmed; nothing else is rewritten, so `` `<projectId>` `` in a code span reads as written.

## States

| State | What shows |
|---|---|
| A document | As above |
| Raw HTML in the text | Shown as text, never run or rendered |
| A link to `javascript:`, `data:` or another scheme a reader cannot follow | Its words, without a link |
| An image from another origin | Its alt text in italics (or "Image not shown"), never fetched |
| A long token in code or a link: a URL, a path, a hash | Breaks anywhere rather than widen its paragraph or table; plain words wrap between words |
| A table with more columns than the card holds | Scrolls inside its own frame; the page never scrolls sideways |
| Empty | Nothing: the caller shows the empty state ("No notes yet") |

## Surfaces

- **Console**: in a card or a page at the reading width (832px), `base`.
- **Mobile**: one column; table cells wrap between words, code in them breaks anywhere, and a table still too wide scrolls in its frame.
- **Embed**: `sm`, in the host's font through the token bridge.

## Agents

An agent's reply in the assistant panel or an embed is written by a model, so it is content nobody vetted: render it with Prose, never as HTML. A link in it is a suggestion the person may follow; it never runs.

## Accessibility

- Headings start at h2 under the page's h1, so the outline stays in order.
- A task box is a disabled checkbox named "Done" or "Not done".
- Contrast: running text `ink-2` and links `accent-ink` hold 4.5:1 on `surface` in every theme and accent.

## Content

- Write for the measure: short paragraphs, a heading per question the reader has.
- Name links by where they go ("the runbook"), never "here".

## Do and do not

- Do render anything a person or a model wrote with Prose.
- Do not add `rehype-raw` or render markdown through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: `node scripts/check.ts` fails on the first, and the second throws the policy away.
- Do not use Prose for the system's own specifications; the Atlas has its own reader, with anchored headings.

## Implementation

```tsx
import { Prose } from '@/components/patterns/prose';

<Card className="p-(--card-pad)"><Prose>{incident.review}</Prose></Card>
<Prose size="sm">{comment.body}</Prose>
```
