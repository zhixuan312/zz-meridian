# Banner

A banner is a message about the page or the card it sits in that stays until it is resolved or dismissed: an incident in progress, a key about to expire, a limit reached.

Status: beta

## Anatomy

1. **Container**: a tinted ground and a 1px border of the tone, `radius-lg` 16px, padding 14px 16px.
2. **Icon**: 16px, the tone's ink.
3. **Title**: `text-sm` medium, the tone's ink: what is happening.
4. **Body** (optional): `t-small`, `ink-2`: what it means and what to do.
5. **Action** (optional): one small button.
6. **Dismiss** (optional): a 24px ghost close.

## Variants

| Tone | Ground | Border | Icon and title | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Neutral | `surface-sunk` | `line` | `ink-3` / `ink` | A fact to know: reporting is in UTC |
| Accent | `accent-tint` | `accent-line` | `accent-ink` | Something new the product offers |
| Positive | `positive-tint` | `positive` at 25% | `positive-ink` | Resolved, restored |
| Warning | `warning-tint` | `warning` at 30% | `warning-ink` | Degraded, expiring, near a limit |
| Critical | `critical-tint` | `critical` at 25% | `critical-ink` | Failing, blocked, expired |

## Sizes

One size; it fills its container. The action sits to the right of the text on wide containers and under it on narrow ones.

## States

| State | Spec |
|---|---|
| Shown | Arrives with its page |
| Dismissed | Removed; the layout closes up. A dismissed banner stays dismissed for the session |

## Behaviour

- Dismiss is offered only for information the person can safely ignore; a critical banner that needs action has no dismiss until it is resolved.

## Surfaces

- **Console**: at the top of the page body or of a card.
- **Mobile**: the same; the action wraps under the text.
- **Embed**: at the top of the view when the data it shows is affected (an incident on the service it reports).

## Agents

An agent's suggestion is not a banner; it is a Proposal. The accent banner announces agent features, never an agent's action.

## Accessibility

- Critical is `role="alert"`; the others `role="status"`.
- The tone is said by the icon and the title, not the colour alone.
- Titles in each tone's ink hold 4.5:1 on its tint in both themes (`pnpm contrast`).

## Content

- The title is the fact: "Elevated latency in eu-west-1", not "Warning".
- The body says what to do or what is being done.

## Do and do not

- Do keep one banner per view; several at once read as noise.
- Do not use a banner to confirm an action the person just took; that is a Toast.

## Implementation

```tsx
import { Banner } from '@/components/ui/banner';

<Banner tone="warning" title="Elevated latency in eu-west-1" action={<Button size="sm">View incident</Button>}>
  Traffic is shifting to eu-central-1.
</Banner>
```
