/**
 * The navigation protocol, twenty times over: every rail route, on a desktop and through the real phone drawer, warm, cold
 * and right after a live refresh, with the nearest-rank p95 of each metric held to the budget.
 *
 *   node scripts/perf.ts --base http://127.0.0.1:3000 [--config scripts/verify.config.ts] [--rail /,/a,/b]
 *
 * It is the journey of scripts/navigate.ts (the press time and the frame clock are the page's own) taken `--samples` times,
 * 20 by default, with no retake: every sample counts, and the gate is the p95 of the lot, never the best of them.
 * - warm: the destination's prefetch and the chunks it brought in finished first, as a visitor who waited would have. A
 *   journey starts from the rail route before its destination (the one after it for the first), so the order a person
 *   browses in is the one measured.
 * - cold: a fresh browser (no cache, no storage, no router state) for every sample, and the page refuses every prefetch of
 *   the destination before it leaves the page. The sample is void, and fails, if the browser's own record shows a request
 *   for the destination made before the press. Other routes are still prefetched and awaited, as in the warm sample, so
 *   the two differ in the destination alone.
 * - after-live: the tab triggers its live provider's resync (an `online` event) and waits until `refreshCollections`
 *   answered `{ ok: true }` and the router read that followed has finished, then presses at once. Nothing is written, so
 *   there is nothing to reset. The starting page is a rail route that registers live data.
 * A sample that never gets ready, shows a wrong result or leaves a dead control fails its combination outright.
 *
 * One line per route, device and condition, and a JSON summary on the last line:
 *
 *   ok|warn|FAIL <route> <device> <condition> shell <median>/<p95>/<max> ms · data … · interactive …[ · drawer <median> ms][ · <reasons>]
 *   perf: {...}
 *
 * A p95 over its budget is a `warn`, a report and never a failure: the protocol is statistical evidence, run weekly, not
 * a release gate. A sample that never got ready or whose control did nothing is a FAIL. Exit non-zero on a FAIL, on a
 * missing mapping (named before anything is sampled) and on a missing Chrome: this is an explicit mode, so a lack of
 * Chrome is never a pass. `--samples` and `--routes` narrow a run for working on the protocol;
 * a narrowed run reports `warn`, never `ok`. The mappings and budgets come from scripts/verify.config.ts.
